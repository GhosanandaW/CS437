# CS437 IoT
CS437 IoT Codebase, created by Ghosananda Wijaya and Anthony Ravnic

## full_self_driving_programs
Contains self driving implementation which includes environment mapping with ultrasonic, path finding with A* algorithm, and traffic sign detection with TensorFlow Lite and OpenCV.

## PiCarX_programs
Contains naive self driving implementation on PiCar-X, the logic includes ultrasonic (distance) avoidance and line (grayscale) avoidance.
